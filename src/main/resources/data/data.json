I took backroads across Connecticut and Rhode Island to get home, and the song came on at just about Providence. Still not knowing the artist, I was disappointed they didn't tell me.\n\nWhen I eventually arrived in Pembroke I thought I was alone, only to be shocked to find @greg{Greg} -- gone since February -- home early from Australia. Together we rode over to Bridgewater State to drop a surprise visit on @bairdo{Bairdo} and @paul{Paul D}, conveniently enrolled in the same class that morning.\n\nUltimately it would be @vog{Vog} staking the most significant claim on the song, canonizing a drunken rendition of the tune and repeating the routine often, spawning many imitators.\n\n#timeline/college.senior #media/radio #media/cd #format/album #player/car.dynasty #player/stereo.3.disc #popular",

I assumed #music/song{Clocks} was the peak because in my mind it blew the first single, #music/song{In My Place}, away.\n\nThe following August, during temporary quarter at @al.mc{Al}, @spoth{Spoth}, and @steveo{Steveo's} in Somerville, I got in with Steveo's MP3 collection, in which I found a live take of Amsterdam. I gave it more attention than other selections then, though at that point I didn't even realize the album contained a studio version of the song.\n\nWhen I finally moved to Allston and set up my new 5-disc - a castoff of @tate{Tate's} - only then did I truly discover Amsterdam, and when I did the whole world came crashing down. @laura{Laura} can confirm that this was the only song I listened to in the opening weeks at the new place. I eventually sent an email to both @leo{Leo} and @sarah{Sarah} suggesting Amsterdam could compete with #music/song{Mouthful Of Cavities} for the saddest song in the world, and I suggested to @toland{John} and @shawn{Shawn} in a Plymouth bar that December that Amsterdam outdid any other song on the album two-fold.\n\n#timeline/allston #media/cd.burned #format/album #player/stereo.tate.castoff #gift.received",

Shortly thereafter I mentioned it to @raffa{Raffa}, @money{Money}, and @q{Q} on a traditional Tuesday run to Big Burrito, at which point they demonstrated some familiarity, but not much.\n\nI didn't realize until picking up the album some time later that I was only especially fond of the outro, which was most of what I'd heard on the radio that one time. Still, I listened to the album, particularly in my room just after a crucial rearrangement, with the head of the bed under the bay windows, just as it was getting warm enough to open them. Opening the windows admitted noise from the nearby Mass Pike, but thankfully, given the geometry of the neighborhood, the sound was reminiscent of a churning ocean, and rather peaceful.\n\n#timeline/allston #media/radio.once #media/record #format/album #player/record.player.nice",

That the song was an address from father to child - even if a distressing one - was a coincidence.\n\nI first heard The Velvet Teen in a Lawrence, Kansas bar, on my trip in 2008, no clue what it was at the time, but determined to lift a few lines from the din and scrawl them on a scrap of paper. I forgot that capture for a while, just one scrap in a pile of many to sift through when I got home, and even then, journal entries taken on loose scraps were dropped when I originally compiled the Web page to recount the trip.\n\nI had never heard of the band before finding out who they were through those lyrics. It's fun to think the musical fabric of the nation is unevenly distributed, such that the bands played in different regions are likewise different, even when within the same genre.\n\n#timeline/maynard.2 #media/itunes #media/cd.burned #format/album #format/mix #player/computer.07 #player/car.laura.altima #player/boombox",

Nice place, pretty empty at the time, I took a pint and sat by myself in a booth half way to the back of the first floor.\n\nMusic played over the speakers wired throughout the room. An etherial, high-energy rock jam sung by a female with perceptible Irish accent had me feeling it. Alas, I figured it was an import appropriated by the venue and something I'd unfortunately never hear again.\n\nLightning struck a few months later, in the car at in the parking lot outside the church awaiting @rux{Rux} and @gina{Gina's} wedding. @laura{Laura} had gone inside, and so I was left alone with the acute realization it was the song again. I so wanted the DJ to tell me who it was, but of course they didn't--radios were robots for the most part by then. The robot did, however, follow with #music/song{Jump Into The Fog} by #music/artist{The Wombats}, which I suppose was a nice consolation.\n\nOnce in the anteroom, I recounted my story to @justin{Justin} and perhaps one other, in the hopes they could help me identify the artist. Neither could. \n\nI don't know why I didn't say it aloud then, but I had a strange inclination to suggest the artist might be, or at least reminded me of, Florence + The Machine. I guess I just didn't have the confidence. That's who it was, though, as I found out after it got a few more plays during my earliest days commuting to SilverRail.\n\n#timeline/kingston.1 #media/channel.venue #media/spotify #media/radio #format/album #player/sound.system #player/car.laura.altima #player/laptop.work.mac #popular",

Still, I wasn't all in. \n\nSome years later, while watching an episode of House with @spoth{Spoth}, a show we regularly watched at The Dike with housemates @tate{Tate} and @suz{Suz}, #music/song{Happiness} played during a poignant moment, and suddenly my time spent w/Shawn's disc came flooding back. Somehow I had forgotten the power of that disc for a few years, and so it had fallen way off the radar. Even given that reminder, however, I failed to become aware the band had yet another level to climb to.\n\nThey finally did achieve institution status for me in early 2013, when my attention turned to their full catalog.

When I remembered it might be worth a try again some years later one morning in our Kingston kitchen, it was pretty easy to find.\n\n#timeline/kingston.3 #media/spotify #format/playlist #player/laptop.11 #player/laptop.work.mac",

I was thrilled to hear that. 104.7 was one of my six presets, despite that it faded out after only a quarter of my commute. \n\nI asked Greg that night if he had ever heard of Dawes. He hadn't.

I had great sympathy for him as a person amid a troubling series of very public escapades in young adulthood, and rooted for him to pull himself together. He seemed to have to done so by the summer of '16, with decent high-profile appearances on the approach, and that's when Sorry hit the radio. At that point I became a Belieber.\n\n#timeline/kingston.3 #media/radio #player/car.black.prius #player/car.red.siena #popular",

Excitement was peak when we met @spoth{Spoth} and @leith{Leith} and their band of merry show-goers at a bar ahead of time, everybody in the neighborhood buzzing with anticipation.\n\nIn advance of the show, in order to work up my enthusiasm, I picked up where I had left off with Pearl Jam, playing almost exclusively from their sixth studio album, #music/album{Binaural}. #music/song{Rival} and Sleight Of Hand were the two songs I played the most.\n\nBy the time of the show, after some thought, I think I had decided that #music/song{Hold On}, an unreleased track from the #music/album{Versus} era, and perhaps #music/song{I Got Id}, were my favorite Pearl Jam songs. They weren't played that night, unfortunately. They did play #music/song{Footsteps}, however, which I hadn't heard in a long time, but had been quite familiar with thanks to a CD loan from a busboy I didn't know so well at Bobby Hackett's restaurant during high school, so I got into that one again for a while after the show, too. \n\n#timeline/kingston.3 #media/spotify #format/album #format/playlist #player/laptop.work.mac",

Second, it led me down some rabbit hole following a trail of artists similar to, influenced by, or otherwise related to each other, until I finally arrived at The Dream Syndicate. @kirk{Kirk}, at @maura{Maura's} birthday party dinner shortly thereafter, mentioned #music/artist{The Soft Boys} in a conversation about music, who I would not have known of if not for following that trail so recently, coincidentally.\n\nBy the end of the summer, I was considering whether #music/album{The Days of Wine and Roses} was one of my ten favorite albums of all time. @annie{Annie}, of her own volition, perhaps after hearing me sing along, would sing aloud as a lark: \"tell me when it's over. oh let me know when it's done !\" She had surprisingly perfect affectation, almost Dylanesque.\n\n#timeline/kingston.3 #media/spotify #format/album #format/playlist #player/laptop.work.mac",
