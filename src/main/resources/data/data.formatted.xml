         <title>Reptilia</title>
         <artist>The Strokes</artist>
         <story>The center of my universe had shifted, from Cambridge and Watertown to Allston and Brighton, with a few key friends living there when I did. That included Laura, who had moved into her own apartment on Washington Street, and Bill and Jenny, up the hill by Saint Elizabeth's Medical Center. In turn, radio songs from the era had a tendency to entwine with my impression of streets emanating from Brighton Center. The first single from The Strokes sophomore effort was no exception.</story>
         <notes>04.02  reptilia - the strokes

                    recall hearing this one in the car somewhere near market and whatever in brighton, near our house, in my car. was all over the radio. second album from the strokes. the first jam off that album to hit the radio, pretty sure.

                    did laura live down there then ? when did she move in w/julie?

                    email to maura 3/23/04:

                    roust from sl a couple days ago. bill and jenny are in
                    the process of buying a house in quincy--i think

         <artist>King Crimson</artist>
         <story>At around the same time I borrowed The Who's Tommy from Andy I bought and began listening to The Compact King Crimson. I had no interest in the first 8 or so tracks, which seemed to cover their more progressive, newer stuff, but I fell hard for the end of the disc, including I Talk To The Wind, Epitaph, and In The Court Of The Crimson King. My youngest brothers - Mike especially - also went for those numbers, which meant I was constantly retrieving the disc from the family computer he played it on. I preferred to listen while shrouded in the darkness of my basement room, alone.</story>

         <title>On The Way Home</title>
         <artist>Buffalo Springfield</artist>
         <story>While hanging out in front of Ben And Jerry's in the student union on a night Maura was working, Rachel and Ben got to talking about the audition for Sweeney Todd in Schenectady the following night, which all three of them were planning to attend. Rachel asked if I wanted to join them, and I think I surprised her by saying yes.

                    Not knowing a thing about musicals, I decided to sing a Neil Young song, aware that Ben had a guitar book of his that would suffice for sheet music. As the audition began, I was surprised at how recognizable the tune emanating from the piano was, simply amazed somebody could convert the opaque symbology into music so effortlessly.

         <artist>Broken Bells</artist>
         <story>It took me until Wincing The Night Away, but I finally got way on board for The Shins. I considered their lyrics unparalleled, a sort of modern day Joni Mitchell, if not for the style, then for the prowess.

                    High Road hit the radio after I'd already heard from Ryan that Broken Bells was one of the bands he was listening to these days, which he told me just outside The Courtside, on a night we were supposed to meet but only did for a minute--I had to catch the 10:50 back to Maynard just as he was arriving.</story>
         <notes>It took me until Wincing The Night Away, but I was way on board for The Shins at that point. I think their lyrics are unparalleled on the leading edge, a sort of modern day Joni Mitchell, if not for style, simply for prowess. High Road hit the radio after I'd heard from Ryan that Broken Bells was one of the bands he was listening to--that was at the courtside well beyond its heyday on a night we were supposed to meet there but he couldn't make it until i was leaving to catch the 1050 back to maynard.

                    hearing this in the car w/eden and laura outside that karaoke place we witnessed but never ended up trying in the suds, i think... somewhere southwestish of maynard.

                    i listen to the high road and vaporize on the broken bells myspace page ~40 times a day.</notes>

         <story>U2 Pop holds the distinction for album I obtained earliest relative to release date. Though the album wasn't slated for the shelves until the following Tuesday that March, the guy at the student union was selling copies the Friday before--not sure how he pulled that off. Regardless, I made my way back to Pembroke that weekend and Mike was impressed I already owned it.

                    Later that summer it was Steveo who was impressed--that I recognized the opening notes to If You Wear That Velvet Dress when we saw U2 at Foxboro. In truth, I was looking out for it--I liked that one.</story>

         <story>I auditioned with Star 69 for the Rusty Pipes, the on-campus a cappella group whose intricacies I was well-familiar with given Elyse ran the group, at least in part. It was kind of a lark, I didn't really expect to end up in the group, and if I'd made it I'd have had to consider a time competition with Ultimate practices and tournaments, but I did get a callback, and that was kinda fun.</story>

         <artist>Diane Birch</artist>
         <story>I bought Diane Birch's Bible Belt CD for Laura for her birthday after hearing Nothing But A Miracle on the radio a few times. The song was a throwback to the 70s singer-songwriter style, with a feel otherwise absent from present day, featuring clever arrangement and a few chord changes that tapped me on the soul.</story>
         <notes>She brought something from seventies singer song writer sound that I hadn't heard... just a few of those chord progressions did that magical thing that most modern music doesn't seem to for me. I loved it. like she found that key that unlocks something in me. heard it on the radio a few times--just enough to suggest it was new and legit and not actually from the seventies or something. bought the cd for laura for her birthday that year.

                    remember hearing it on the way to a summer league ultimate game by car somewhere bewteen alewife and maynard.</notes>

         <story>Poem was my introduction to Taproot on the radio, and as I told Christina when discussing radio music at the time, I though it was OK, but Calling - their next song - was so much better. Unfortunately in the scheme of things, this felt like the trailing end of the genre's popularity--a sort of last gasp for the heavier, if melodic, rock. Blue Sky Research was one in a stack of CDs I kept in Spoth's old room after he moved out, which I listened to while using the Linux machine I'd set up in there.</story>
         <notes>05.13  calling - taproot

                    poem was ok, but this was way better

                    i feel like christina and i talked about this band at one point

                    i bought this cd... used it in spoth's room after he'd moved out

                    strong representative for AAF as my (and society's, it seemed) taste for the hard rock was waning)

         <artist>Beck</artist>
         <story>Tate Limewired several selections from Beck's Sea Change to his Mac, and those selections, including Paper Tiger, inspired my interest in the album. That winter, Paul and I listened to the CD on the way to visit John in Brooklyn, where we listened to the CD a few more times throughout the weekend. I claimed then it was the best album to come out in years.</story>

         <story>Time Is Running Out heralded the arrival of Muse, and they were pretty easy to get behind.

         <story>That spring break I took Leo, Paul, and Webber to RPI to visit Maura. Leo brought with him a handful of CDs, including the first Beck album and Ritual De Lo Habitual. I was taken by the longer songs towards the end of Ritual, ultimately developing a habit of beginning the disc on track 6 upon retreat to Maura's dorm.

                    Following "recognition" at the Academy, at which point we were finally allowed to openly possess and use stereos, I borrowed the Ritual CD from my new friend Ben, known most of the preceding year as Cadet Smith.</story>

                    during that spring break, i took leo, paul, and chris out to rpi to visit maura, stopping by nate rusin's in connecticut on the ride out there. leo brought with him a handful of cds, including the first beck album and "ritual de lo habitual." i was taken by the longer songs towards the end of the album to the point where, following "recognition" at the academy (when we were finally allowed to have radios), i borrowed the cd from ben across the hall. prior to recognition, ben was known as "cadet smith."

                    kept tapping forward to number 6.  when we finally got
                    radio priveledges at air force, i borrowed the cd from
                    an upperclassman.  at rpi i regularly borrowed it from

                    always loved carly's uncertainty and insecurity coming through in her music. why didn't she get as much hype as carole king / joni / anybody else ?</notes>

Fortunately in this case that happened just before Somebody Told Me fell off the radio, providing an opportunity for me to get into it. I was definitely grateful for what seemed a harbinger of a new synth-washed movement, all Duran Duran like, plus the line about "a boyfriend who looked like a girlfriend that I had in February of last year" seemed like a fun new vibe, which Mr. Brightside would soon corroborate.</story>

                    another car radio in the allston neighborhood song, winter melting away. the laundromat. i didn't want to like this because i didn't like the name of the band. this was their first song. harbinger of the new synth movement. all duran duran like. like the lines about "you had a boyfriend who looked like a girlfriend that i had in february of last year" that seemed like a new vibe.

                    did "and my stomach is sick" come out before this? yeah, maybe... that was when i didn't want to like this band... or was it the reverse? i'll get clear on this.</notes>

         <title>Float On</title>
         <artist>Modest Mouse</artist>
         <story>Float On was my introduction to Modest Mouse, a band I had heard about plenty in the years prior from my indie friends but had never actually heard myself. The song was all over the radio by the time Laura and I flew to Seattle for Shawn and Alicia's wedding that May, where it was played twice, making it the song of the night in a landslide.

                    Some time later, when musing with Spoth about whether there were any acts who make the big time without having a particularly great lead voice, we independently came up with these guys. Were we wrong?</story>
         <notes>04.09  float on - modest mouse

                    shawn and alicia's wedding in seattle--this song was played 2ce.

                    all over the radio at the time.

                    had heard about modest mouse from leo and other indie friends before this, now they are mainstream ish.

                    some time later talking to spoth about popular artists that don't necessarily have a good voice but who are artists nonetheless...i was thinking of this band and he suggested it w/o knowing i was already thinking it.</notes>

         <story>I borrowed the first Ben Folds Five CD from Tom when he was my housemate back at the 14th Street frisbee house, and accidentally packed it when I left almost 3 years prior. In anticipation of finally returning the CD at the annual Thanksgiving festival I was planning to attend in Troy, I popped it into the kitchen boombox and got spent on number 5 in particular: Selfless, Cold, and Composed. Shawn was just fine with that. Alicia was too, at least for a minute, until she got sick of how much we played it.</story>

         <artist>Perry Farrell</artist>
         <story>And so began the Twilight phenomenon. Laura and I went to see it before we knew it was based on a book, inspired solely by mild Internet hype, even before we'd seen any TV commercials for it, believe it or not. When I asked the teenage girl at the ticket booth whether it was any good she could barely contain herself, relishing the opportunity to provide an editorial film critique. Apparently it was so good.

                    I fell for the movie almost immediately, for the Pacific Northwest setting to which I had strong emotional ties, plus the music, which was fantastic. Loved the Mutemath Spotlight reprise. And what a wonderful surprise to later find the high-energy emo dance song playing at the prom was Perry Farrell. That guy was everywhere!</story>

         <story>On the strength of her performance that night at the Middle East Downstairs I bought one of the CDs she was pedaling, and was not disappointed. I wore that thing out over the next month or more, particularly a fan of Brand New.

                    There was a moment where she and I crossed paths on the stairs before that show, well before it was crowded, where I sensed her purpose but also suspected her humanity. I regarded the experience as a very early blurring of the line between myself and people in bands that play out in clubs, realizing, like, they're just people too.

                    That and I was starstruck a little.</story>

         <story>JT was at the top of his game, and What Goes Around would remain the crowning achievement for a long time, if not forever. I had liked Cry Me A River, and sort of liked the rest of his radio stuff, but this one was off the chart. The richly produced video starring Scarlet Johansson was more than a worthy counterpart, and the reason to tune into the VH1 countdown every weekend for almost half a year.</story>

Taking the nod to Tori Amos from Maura, I borrowed Little Earthquakes from the pool and fell particularly hard for Precious Things. Processing that rapid fire piano, hanging out on the bookshelf by our open 6th floor window, looking down on the quad where frisbee and sunbathing now happened, all following months of a much different lifestyle, was definitely powerful.

                    the cd pool that flourished after recognition was another interesting academy-oriented music phenomenon.  taking the nod to tori amos from maura, i adopted somebody's "little earthquakes," shane lamond's i think.  hanging out on the bookshelf by the open window in our 6th floor room, looking down on the quad where frisbee and sunbathing happened, following recognition after months of what have you, music was definitely powerful then.

         <title>California Soul</title>
         <artist>Marlena Shaw</artist>
         <story>As sad as it was to learn about California Soul from a TV commercial, it was sadder still to look forward to commercial breaks hoping to hear it. That's what I did, though, my whole world pulling towards whatever genre had that song at its epicenter--some yet unknown-to-me classic soul wing of history. And how could one beat (the opening one) convey so much?

                    I started listening to the song over youtube, which required a manual restart, but I got used to it. At work I was just sitting in front of my computer all the time anyway. I was sharing an office with Rodney at that point, JT to replace him by the time I returned from hiatus.

                    Only after getting into the youtube habit with California Soul did I get into the same habit with I Will Possess Your Heart, clearly not clear of my radar yet, and which at 8 1/2 minutes meant less restarts per hour.
                </story>
         <notes>yes, i learned about this song from a tv commercial, but who cares?! what a jam this is. i felt my whole world pull towards whatever genre had this at its epicenter... some yet unknown, unexplored classic soul wing of history.

                    i started listening to this primarily over youtube, which, yes, required that i restart it each time, but at work i was sitting in front of my computer continually anyway. in rodney's office by this point, which would become me and jt by the time i got back after traveling.

                    that first drum hit--how can one beat convey so much?!</notes>

I did so for the most part on the Fisher Price "toy" record player we had, set at the time on a shelf in the room shared by my two youngest brothers, Mike and Steve. That setup relegated my listening to the hours they were awake, school afternoons and weekends, mostly, and it also meant they shared in my discovery, especially on that album.</story>

         <title>Sail On, Sailor</title>
         <artist>The Beach Boys</artist>
         <story>There was a melody I'd been singing to myself for quite some time that I believed belonged to a real song, some seventies era underground lost classic, but I never heard it on the radio, so I just couldn't place it. I carried it with me for years and doubted myself.

                    Vindication came in the spring of '09. The melody came pouring out of the TV during a crucial scene in The Departed, the words revealing themselves and providing the requisite clue. And the answer the Internet provided was even more satisfying. It was The Beach Boys. Sail On Sailor.

                    What made this answer so satisfying was that I had already fallen hard for one of their songs from the same era--Feel Flows, featured in Almost Famous. I wondered whether it was possible this incredibly popular band I hadn't paid much attention my whole life might be responsible for a wealth of music I would love and had yet to explore.</story>
         <notes>There was a melody that I'd been singing to myself for quite some time that I believed belonged to a real song in the world, some seventies era underground or lost classic. I carried this with me for years. Then that spring I caught most of The Departed on TV and the melody came pouring out the television as crucial accompaniment to a scene in the film. The words revealed themselves and I had the clue I needed. The Internet gave me the answer, an extremely satisfying one at that: it was The Beach Boys. The song Sail On Sailor.

                    That it was The Beach Boys was particularly great because I had already fallen hard for one of their seventies songs--Feel Flows. Was it possible this super-popular band that I hadn't paid much attention to my whole life might be responsible for a strain of music that I would love and had somehow gone undiscovered for so long?

                    at some time early that year i caught most of The Departed on tv and heard that song i'd been singing to myself and that i suspected existed for so long

                    i love thinking that there are those with much closer associations to this song and its actual release or anything to do with this song in the almost forty years between when it was released and when i truly discovered it.</notes>

         <artist>Guns N' Roses</artist>
         <story>J and I loved Guns 'n Roses. Jim did too, after rejecting them initially, no matter that Magall and I spent a bus ride to junior high one morning trying to convince him to like them. That was back when Leo liked them as well - he was responsible for the copies I had of Appetite and Lies, albums I wouldn't let my parents catch me with - but unlike the rest of us, he unashamedly bowed out upon hearing the Use Your Illusions.

                    At the height of Use Your Illusion hype the first two albums enjoyed a sort of Renaissance, at least amongst my friends. J and I would sound the opening guitar riff to the slow version of Your Crazy often, akin to movie quoting, primary means of communication at that age. We went on to develop alt lyrics for that and other GNR gems, referring to our art as "canciones," an homage to the Spanish classes we were getting more out of than we realized.</story>
         <notes>Greg got Use Your Illusion I and I got II that Christmas

                    The Use Your Illusion discs amplified that and brought about a sort of Renaissance for the first two, especially Lies, and especially the second side. Patience already had its place in history, squared center on junior high courtesy extensive radio play then, and I Used To Love Her was right there with it for its novelty. I had a strong affinity for

         <artist>Yes</artist>
         <story>The first time I heard Starship Trooper was on ZLX doing my paper route, and I was pleasantly surprised to find it on the only Yes album among my parents' remaining records. Not long after that I caught it on the radio a second time, in the Mitsubishi Mirage, after dropping off Greg in Bryantville on my way to a party at Gretchen's.

                    That ride to Gretchen's was so adventurous. I was still new to my license anyway, but the darkness, the unfamiliarity of the region, and that most of route 58 was dirt for repaving - not to mention the background music - all contributed to the effect.</story>

Only much later did I call him on it, at which point he recounted I had cited love for Neil, whom he also liked, and so he put two and a few together.</story>

                    It was their performance to close out the Grammy's that year that changed me, not just on music, but on life. Their exhibition of creativity, with everybody running around that stage, demure fashion sense, energy, enthusiasm, dude with a megaphone--it engendered a steady and determined sobriety in me. I wanted to dedicate myself to creativity too.</story>

                    I found the tape a few days later, and after interrogating my sister and other family members I simply resigned to the improbability of its appearance and "borrowed" the tape indefinitely. In retrospect it seems a little odd how accepting I was of the coincidence. The mystery went cold until around the time of graduation, at which point the truth was revealed.</story>

         <title>Amsterdam</title>
         <artist>Coldplay</artist>
         <story>My first experience with Amsterdam was an overheard conversation. I was in Philadelphia the previous summer for an Ultimate tournament with Metal, and Nick and Watson were comparing their favorite songs off the second Coldplay album. Watson touted The Scientist, which I hadn't heard yet - it was almost another year before it was all over the radio - and Nick mentioned Amsterdam, not as his front runner but as a worthy selection.

                    For my birthday at the end of that year Mike made me a copy of A Rush Of Blood To The Head, which I listened to sporadically but never quite intently. I assumed Clocks was the peak because in my mind it blew the first single, In My Place, away.

                    The following August, during temporary quarter at Al, Spoth, and Steveo's in Somerville, I got in with Steveo's MP3 collection, in which I found a live take of Amsterdam. I gave it more attention than other selections then, though at that point I didn't even realize the album contained a studio version of the song.

                    When I finally moved to Allston and set up my new 5-disc - a castoff of Tate's - only then did I truly discover Amsterdam, and when I did the whole world came crashing down. Laura can confirm that this was the only song I listened to in the opening weeks at the new place. I eventually sent an email to both Leo and Sarah suggesting Amsterdam could compete with Mouthful Of Cavities for the saddest song in the world, and I suggested to John and Shawn in a Plymouth bar that December that Amsterdam outdid any other song on the album two-fold.</story>

I gave him something, only to have him return it and inform me it was Beth Orton's Central Reservation mistakenly placed inside. Hey, alright, I was happy to have that one back, and immediately began playing it on a regular basis, usually in darkness but for streetlights and vanilla candles. </story>

On the youtube video comments they referred to it as Northern Soul, a concept I'd never encountered before.</story>

         <story>Some time that winter I began to fall extremely hard for Counting Crows, a band I had resisted my whole life. There were always plenty around me who loved them, and maybe that was the problem. John loved them. Laura did too. Spoth I only met much later and life, but he had a backstory to match theirs.

                    Within a year I'd be over it all, entertaining thoughts that Goodnight Elizabeth was one of my favorite ten songs in the world. That was as I sang along with it - as loudly as possible a hundred times or more - on a solo road trip to visit my parents in Florida the following January.</story>

                    also ended up falling so hard for i'm not sleeping and the "got to get out on my own" song.</notes>

         <artist>Radiohead</artist>
         <story>I loved the new Radiohead song that was all over the radio in the spring of '08, but nobody seemed to know which one I was talking about. When I tried to describe it most asked if I was talking about House Of Cards, which I only realized months later - listening to the album on Steveo's roofdeck in D.C. with Steveo and Spoth - was much softer, and, well, critically, a different song. The one I liked was called Bodysnatchers.</story>
         <notes>ah, the new radiohead. ran the airwaves parallel to possess your heart.... man, dominated the airwaves toghether. i heard both of them on one trip over to rob's that spring.

                    i didn't know the name of this one at the time, just that it was the raging new radiohead... everytime i said i liked what i'd heard on the radio, people would suggest the title "house of cards," which i learned while playing the album at steveo's at the outset of my travels that year was not the name of the one i thought was awesome, though i suppose it was ok. a lot softer, though.</notes>

         <story>Despite being the youngest kid in our class, Josh was way ahead of his time. That March he collaborated with Ms. Young - our English teacher from the previous year - to put on a coffee house at the community center, outside of school, at a time we still needed our parents to drop us off and pick us up.

                    A small group of students attended, myself included. We read poetry, listened to music, and otherwise felt almost like we were just hanging out--except, of course, there was a teacher in our midst. We took turns using the boombox. At mine I played Everybody's Been Burned by The Byrds, my favorite song at the time and ultimately among those discovered in tenth grade.</story>

                    14. EVERYBODY'S BEEN BURNED--byrds (spring 1992)
                    i assessed this as my favorite song of 10th grade.  i
                    wrote the lyrics to the last verse on a desk in ms.
                    warren's room, and i had to say "no" when katie t.

The first time was just about February vacation senior year, the time my whole family went to Florida except for Greg and I. Of course we had friends over the whole time, but we weren't out of line--we just played a ton of Nerf hoop, rented Pink Floyd The Wall at Blockbuster - first time seeing it for all of us - and, well, Greg did beat up Paul with no hands... not real bad, though. He just kept pecking him, like a chicken or something, both of them helplessly plagued with laughter.</story>

         <artist>Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer</artist>
         <story>Despite their presence in my parents' record collection, it took me a while to find Emerson Lake and Palmer. The song lengths were intimidating, plus some parts of the record were so quiet and so scratched that when I did finally copy it to tape I captured minutes of what amounted to static. It's surprising, actually, how much cumulative time I spent waiting out that noise.</story>

                    despite their presence in my parent's record collection, it took me a while to find emerson lake and palmer--perhaps the song lengths were too intimidating for me.  because certain parts of "take a pebble" are so quiet, and because this record was particularly scratched up, when i copied this song to tape i captured minutes of what amounts to static.

         <artist>Ugly Kid Joe</artist>
         <story>Cats In The Cradle was my favorite song on the radio in eleventh grade. I liked the original, and so I was happy it got covered, but by the time the dust settled I realized I much preferred Ugly Kid Joe's harder rocking version.

                    To my delight the song got plenty of hype on the TNT on AAF, the standard radio measure of the era. It even managed to wrest the top spot from Dennis Leary's I'm An Asshole, which at the time seemed impossible. Most folks remember where they were when that happened--I was riding passenger in Jim's "blue meanie," snow falling steadily along a dark and quiet route 44 following a Silver Lake tournament basketball game in Taunton.</story>
         <notes>Route 44 was quiet


                    93.03  cats in the cradle--ugly kid joe
                    "cats in the cradle" got plenty of hype on aaf's tnt, the standard radio measure of the era. i personally assessed it as my favorite radio song of 11th grade. i taped the song and a few others off the radio, listening to the tape in the van riding back from grammy's cottage after raking there for the first time.


                    17. CAT'S IN THE CRADLE--ugly kid joe (early 1993)
                    how big was this song in the last half of 11th grade?
                    big.  i used to think the original was good, and that
                    made this one good, but listening to the old one
                    doesn't move me as much as the fiery ugly kid joe
                    version did riding in the blue meanie on the way home
                    from the silver lake basketball tournament game in
                    taunton (the one where it snowed--not the one with the
                    fight)--the song dethroned dennis leary's "im an
                    asshole" on the WAAF TNT that night.</notes>

Life was so great then.</story>

                    i hadn't been carrying with me how awesome this song was at this point in my life--i learned it via calista's cd, and so it was a revelation in the summer of 2006.</notes>

                    i loved this song on the radio so hard that i actually got to using the radio in my room when i moved into tate's. laura noticed how much i went for this song and got me the franz ferdinand disc for the next christmas / birthday / something else ?

                    the transition from the intro to the jam never got old, no matter how much this got played, which was a lot.

                    loved that the "i know i won't be leaving here" part sounded like an early 80s video game.

                    i remember hearing perhaps on the radio some time after this that franz ferdinand wanted to change things up, and either ditch the electronics or embrace them, the latter perhaps for wanting not to be just another guitar rock band.</notes>

Spoth and I even took to listening to FNX in the house around then. Unfortunately for Tate and Suzie, that was usually after closing out the Courtside on a Thursday night, and while playing ping pong in the room underneath where they slept. Tate's own fault for wiring the speakers into the room from the stereo in the wet bar closet, I suppose.</story>

                    hadn't heard this one or anything by them since them. man does this bring back the time.

         <story>I didn't end up listening to the Red House Painters disc I'd bought for the '08 trip until I was on the way back, leaving Sedona on a leg from Candice's mom's in Glendale to Abby's friends' in Santa Fe. The extended, haunting outro to Mother manifested as I was switching my way up the canyon wall, a return the experience Laura and I had three years earlier.</story>
         <notes>finally put this disc in leaving sedona on my way north away from candice's mom barbara and dave's house on my way to abby's friends sarah and dan's house in new mexico. the extended end of this song snuck up on me--i was dealing with switching my way up the canyon wall, something i hadn't done in three years, the first time laura and i visited the area.

                    that ethereal ending... so haunting. i wish for it never to end each time i hear it.</notes>

                    I was excited to learn Money had also gotten and was into the album, citing Kids With Guns as his favorite. Mine didn't stray from the single that hooked me in the first place.</story>

                    gorillaz had been hype since "sunshine in a bag" song years before, but i'd never gone for them. this song floored me, compelled me, required me to go get this album.</notes>

         <artist>Roxy Music</artist>
         <story>I caught a version of this song in a short rotation with a few others while waiting for a flight to take off in Chicago after a business trip. Upon return to Internet access I discovered it was 10,000 Maniacs, post Natalie Merchant. I also discovered it was a cover, then discovered I had the original on my computer already. I started listening to Avalon a lot then, an album that seemed quite a bit less brazen than the Roxy Music I was familiar with.</story>
         <notes>04.17  more than this - roxy music

                    caught a version of this, female vox, on a jetblue flight, in a short rotation while waiting to take off. business trip w/bob o'connor and maybe another or two ? was that chicago ? discovered it was 10000 maniacs after merchant had left, also discovered it was a cover, then discovered i had the song in the FMP, and started listening a lot to Avalon.

                    such a perfect sound this album has. especially more than this. and the title track. very diff sound than what i knew - for your pleasure, love is the drug.</notes>

         <story>I heard Until The End Of The World on a "future classics" segment on ZLX, the classic rock station over which my boombox stereo dial had presided since eighth grade. I had already fallen hard for The Joshua Tree and War, but like all music released before the "epoch" - that period sometime during junior high when music transitioned from an accepted dictation to a clamorous hunt - they were part of a disconnected, distant past, even if it had only been five years in real time. Now, U2 was part of the present.

                    I bought Achtung Baby that spring, unaware of how monumental it would become--alas, it proved one of the most colossal albums of high school. As happens with many great albums, my favorite rotated through about half the tracks, in this case most of which reminded me of Sarah, my then-girlfriend, first of the post-junior high kind.</story>
         <notes>92.07  love is blindness--u2
                    "achtung baby" proved one of the most colossal albums of the high school years.  "love is blindness" was in my head while spending time with sarah on the basketball court in bryan furze's backyard at his combined birthday party with gretchen that year.</notes>

He was just about the most captivating character I had seen on that stage, and that was kinda saying something, given I'd been all over the show since it began.  Adam's rendition of Ring Of Fire was an instant classic, but only when he bested it a few weeks later with his take on Mad World did I start using the Internet to enjoy an Idol performance beyond the night it aired.</story>

         <title>Surf's Up 1967 (Solo Version)</title>
         <artist>The Beach Boys</artist>
         <story>Laura knew The Beach Boys had all but become my favorite band. The previous year she DVRed a TV movie about them for me, of her own volition, and I couldn't have been happier. She also knew I was far more into what they did after they started "losing it," so to speak, and so for Christmas that year she got just about the greatest gift I'd ever gotten--the SMiLE sessions 5-disc set.

                    It had a few selections I'd known from the Beach Boys Classics disc I was familiar with, but a great many versions of each, plus plenty of stuff that was new to me as well. I particularly enjoyed the raw, solo version of Surf's Up, a song I'd already targeted as one of the best examples of how awesome they were.

                    Learning about The Beach Boys in my thirties was almost akin, unbelievably, to learning about the likes of Led Zeppelin and other classic rock giants at the outset of my music hunting days, and I was grateful to have managed to defer something so fascinating, however inadvertantly.</story>

Really sold the humanity of the band.</story>

         <artist>U2</artist>
         <story>Early that summer Electrical Storm was huge. I knew it to be a "standalone," or the extent of new U2 at the time, rather than representative of an album full of new material, and as such that it had no chance to be anything but a radio song for me, but I heard it enough, particularly on my commute to Crescent Ave in Dorchester, the side street where I'd park in my earliest ITA days, just a short walk under the elevated expressway to JFK/UMass where I caught the red line to Cambridge.</story>
         <notes>02.13  electrical storm - u2

                    what was this on? it wasn't on an album, was it? it was huge that spring... reminds me of commuting to crescent ave, early in my ita days... did i do that then? must've.

                    everytime they were doing something new by this time, i was continually amazed that it felt like my fav u2... is that 'cause the old stuff always grew tired ?</notes>

                    what was the consensus on the movie "donnie darko"? think if i
                    watched it a hundred times i wouldn't get the whole thing. the kid i
                    borrowed it from taught me 10 times as much as i picked up in a one
                    watch - stuff he heard from the director's commentary and found on

                    I had known this song and most Leslie Gore songs that got play already, and especially loved the darker stuff - You Don't Own Me, say - but I was starting to go for the happy stuff too. And I like to imagine what Leslie Gore might have meant to me had I grown up in her era. Maybe something like I felt about Madonna. Or Debbie Gibson. Belinda Carlisle circa 6th grade. Something like that.</story>

                    i hadn't yet given "house at pooneil corners" its due attention, perhaps because it was long, or at the end of the cd. the cd played out in my basement around july or so, rekindling my jefferson airplane love without costing the price of another album. when i eventually got around to drawing leo's window shades about a month later, the centerpiece of my efforts was an image of grace slick.

                    how about the poem / song similarity / posterboard project ? was it finding the likeness between a poem and song lyrics ? something about light vs darkness, how things get uglier and scarier once darkness sets ?

I liked the song then but hadn't heard from them since, making me particularly excited to see what that one was all about.

                    We usually tapped forward to Der Kommissar (#3) to begin things, but since Bill had staked a claim on that song to accommodate his alter ego - aptly, "Der Kommissar" - Smalltown Boy (#4) represents the soundtrack here.

Among the most popular videos at the time was Fell In Love With A Girl, The White Stripes Lego-mation jam that put them on the map.</story>

                    bbjones from may 10:

                    ---
                    jones, i am mired in depression.

                    i want to feel vital.

                    these are the two words that have boxed out for position in my head.
                    let's talk about videos--i was taken by the white stripes video where
                    they use lego-mation, and also by the zero 7 "destiny" video where
                    they use black and white images reminiscent of a-ha's take on me.
                    the new korn is aptly disturbing.

                    not much left in here, huh, jones? i don't think of you as dead--i
                    think of you as available.

                    rich s

         <title>Here To Stay</title>
         <artist>Korn</artist>
         <story>Dad picked me up at the Providence airport and drove me to Allison's in Southie. Here To Stay came on the radio somewhere along Day Boulevard and I told him it was the best song on the radio at the time. It continued to get plenty of radio play in Massachusetts that spring, including once on AAF after which Mistress Carey hyped the song and the band so hard to my delight. She explained with level dispassion that whether or not you were a Korn fan, this fifth album of theirs would elevate them to a level that will make them not soon forgotten.</story>
         <notes>02.06  here to stay - korn

                    from "feelings are the fourth dimension" bbjones (mar 18, 02):

                    i love the new korn song. as it finished on aaf in my living room
                    this morning, i hoped mistress carey would have something to say about
                    it; sure enough, i was not disappointed. she went on to very calmly
                    state that whether or not you're a korn fan, this 5th and upcoming
                    album of theirs is going to raise them to the "next level," making
                    them one of the bands that in 15 years will still be talked about.

                    it just occurred to me that i did this at karaoke at the c-side... i loved doing it... i couldn't even remember what song it was til i just started playing it.

                    also, i think i told dad i loved this song on the ride home from the providence airport to allison's in southie</notes>

         <story>On another trip to the London, Ontario office, I had a free weekend to drive around and enjoy the place. I drove to Stratford, where some kind of a Shakespearian festival takes place annually, and made my way back to London on backroads, stopping in at some small town and into a used CD store. The attendant was playing Duran Duran's Big Thing, and so I called him on it--that spawned serious discussion about 80s music. He was well versed, describing for me the sequence of events that partially broke the Human League into themselves and Heaven 17, and informing me that Heaven 17 was "thinking man's music." I found Big Thing on tape in there and purchased it for myself.</story>

         <story>An email from Jim entitled "annual music recommendation" was just that, and delivered--I ended up listening quite a bit to Magnolia Electric Co. on the Web.</story>
         <notes>email from jim feb 11 11 titled 'Annual music recommendation':

                    ---
                    So Pandora lead me down the road to an artist/album that I never heard of, which
                    I then purchased on iTunes (technology, eh).


                    Magnolia Electric Company
                    Trials and Errors

                    Its a live album.  This dude / band sounds so much like the slow / heavy /
                    general bad ass / Neil Young &amp; Crazy Horse style county rock (which is my
                    favorite version of Neil).  Not in a bad rip-off way (although there are some
                    song quotes), but just a style that is similar.

                    I haven't looked into other albums, but this one seriously kicks ass in my
                    opinion.  I've listened to it nonstop since getting it earlier this week.  No
                    idea it existed, but I recommend it.

         <story>Laura and I heard the song on the radio for the first time up near the Burlington Mall, out to experience Americana on her birthday by indulging a chain restaurant. We bought the album in Borders after dinner, little did we know The Pot would become the radio song of the year. It was still crushing the radio months later, including in the parking lot at Borderlands the day before our wedding, as me and most of my best men plus Rodney and Vog were about to play disc golf. Peter went on to win our 6-way card that day, while Vog took honors in the other group.</story>
         <notes>06.14  the pot - tool

                    heard this on laura's birthday up near the burlington mall, out to dinner and to the bookstore to buy the latest tool after hearing it in the parking lot. it was all over the radio that summer. it was still killing it by the time i was playing disc golf the day before i got married w/most of my best men plus rodney and vogel. peter won that day on our 6-way card, beating rodney and myself among others--what a triumph.

                    pretty sure vicariously had already done quite a bit of time on the radio by then.

                    we went to see tool with tate and suz the night my bachelor party began.</notes>

I loved the whole vibe, but particularly Blue Ridge Mountains, near the end of the album, noting that not only did they pull off harmonies reminiscent of the CSN I loved so much, but the singer's voice even reminded me a bit of a young David Crosby.</story>

Hopefully it was OK I spoke for everybody there.</story>

I also got my first CD--Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young's 4-Way Street. We had that album on record already, and I had been listening to for a while, but the scratches were particularly offensive on it, plus the CD was on sale, not to mention bonus tracks. Triad struck me particularly, not just because Crosby's vocals were golden, but because I felt akin to the story, weighing my relationships with Sarah and Maura.</story>

         <title>Colour My World</title>
         <artist>Chicago</artist>
         <story>Lacking an obvious choice, Laura and I thought long and hard about a wedding song. Color My World was a late entrant, but the simplicity and perfect lyric, from both a band and an Almost Famous scene we liked, made it the winner.

                    I divulged to Greg, Bill, and Andy that they would love the selection, but provided no additional clues, confident they could not guess but aware it was likely to generate a reaction. Not to say I predicted Greg's audible "oh snap" obscenity, but man was that classic.</story>
         <notes>06.16  color my world - chicago

                    laura and i thought very long and hard about a wedding song. this was a very late entrant, but the simplicity and appropriate simplicity of the lyrics made it the choice. i had given to divulging to greg, bill, and andy that they would love the choice, but wouldn't furnish any additional clues. greg's audible "oh shit" when the music started - remember, this is a first dance moment - was priceless.</notes>

         <story>Mer De Noms was, hands down, the album of the year for 2000. Almost any song on that CD could have served as a representative here, alas I determined Sleeping Beauty was my favorite. I was disappointed to see that Larry, the Tool fanatic at Rowecom, had listed the song as his least favorite on the disc - not to say he didn't like it, though - I mean, he had the lyrics posted to his Website well before the album was released.

                    Anyway, the standout listen to this album was with J that summer, giving the Watertown kitchen a good cleaning over a weekend, a process that took until 4 in the morning.</story>

         <story>In late September I moved out of Pembroke and into Watertown with Tate and Matt, the same place they lived in when I last lived in Watertown just a few blocks away. I inhabited their lone attic room, the cramped space where Paul lived for most of the time since our Watertown apartment broke up but had recently vacated.

                    Pulling up to the formerly familiar left at the huge intersection by Mount Auburn Hospital, I caught on the radio the newly unearthed Nirvana song, recently released with a box set of some kind, and decided on first listen that I quite liked it.</story>

Convenient to have the albums back to back, anyway.

                    I explored the For The Roses side on Brandon's stereo while doing dishes in the 15th St Frisbee House, his room set adjacent to the kitchen. A year or two later, while driving into Hartford on my way to see Laura at Trinity, I accidentally flung the tape out the window, trying to rewind it with a pen, then watched it bound down the highway after me in the rearview.</story>

Later that day, while driving around her college campus together in the Dynasty and looking for a parking spot, intent on meeting J and K in a school gym for a Rusted Root concert, New Moon On Monday struck like lightning.

         <artist>Mutemath</artist>
         <story>Upon realizing my myspace habit could easily extend beyond local bands, I began to recall fliers never taken. Mutemath was one of them.

                    I had heard Typical in a feature slot on the radio long before, in my car at the lunch hour, over by the Kendall movie theatre garage. Months or even a year went by before I heard it again, somewhere near Allison's house in Norwood, again in the middle of a workday.

                    Obviously I was noticing, but alas, more months went by, their myspace page always just a click away.

                    Finally I used it, and then again and again. I bought their album just before leaving on my road trip, and was playing it the day I picked up Spoth and Leith at their motel in Austin. Spoth picked right up on it, recognizing and claiming he liked Mutemath, submitting that his favorite was Chaos.

                    Mine was still Typical.</story>
         <notes>still using myspace to take in music, but starting even to do so for not just local bands. i had heard this song while in my car at the lunch hour by the movie theatre garage a long while before this, then months or even a year went by before i heard it again, over near allison's house in norwood in the middle of a weekday, but i remembered it and took note. eventually some straw broke a camel's back and i ended up on the bands myspace page. the rest is history. i bought the album just before leaving on my road trip, along w/two others: the red house painters and rustic overtones, the former i knew because of the dragonflies song on a mix tom s made for calista, the latter of which i'd heard of and heard once, picking up with ryan and others at an early season ultimate tournament in maine somewhere.

                    rob didn't like it as much as i wanted him to.

                    spoth picking up on the mutemath in austin, saying he liked chaos the best either before it began or def before the chorus, proving he knew what he was talking about.</notes>

         <story>After cluing Justin in to the fact that I'd fallen hard for Alterbridge, figuring it was something he'd appreciate, knowing we were both graduates of the same modern hard rock movement, he asked me if I'd ever heard Metalingus, his favorite by the band. I hadn't. That made my second Courtside birthday / New Years Eve party - just around the corner - convenient, as he could include the song on Sunfly Favorites discs 3 and 4, another double CD installment mix he was planning as a gift.</story>

I suppose this list reflects my obsession with the calendar and time. I still thought Harry's House / Centerpiece was a better song, though.</story>

                    However misguided, I was taken by its beauty. Knowing Sarah was familiar with the album amplified the effect, as if her complicity in playing the tape was her suggesting, however tacitly, this music represented her.</story>

         <artist>Carolina Liar</artist>
         <story>While traveling in '08 I heard a few times a particular new song I found myself quite liking. It once emanated from a passing car as I walked the city blocks of downtown Austin.

                    I never went looking for the song after returning home, and it kind of slipped my mind until the following summer. Cook and I were on the open highway in the middle of the night en route to D.C. for Spoth's birthday when the song came on the radio, first time I'd heard it since my trip. This time was different, however--the voice was incredibly familiar. How could that be?

                    In the interim I'd become familiar with the videos and music of what I assumed was a band I'd never heard before, but it turned out the Carolina Liar from Show Me What I'm Looking For was the same band doing I'm Not Over. I couldn't wait to call Laura the next morning and impart my revelation.</story>

On the way to D.C. for Spoth's birthday in a car with Cook, open highway, middle of the night, the song came on again, first time I'd heard it since my trip. This time, though, I recognized the voice as one I knew well. What had happened was, in the interrim, I had become familiar with videos and music from what I just assumed was a new band. Putting the pieces together, I discovered that I'm Not Over was the same Carolina Liar that did Show Me What I'm Looking For. I called Laura the next morning--couldn't wait to tell her. I spent a lot of time on their myspace page after that.</notes>

In fact, I didn't get around to falling for it completely until fall '98, on the stereo in the small loft room off the back of the kitchen in the 14th St Frisbee House, during my extra semester at RPI.</story>

                    Check My Brain was first to hit the radio, with a well placed "California" in the lyrics (I love that for some reason), but as good as it was, the second single, Your Decision, was even better. Todd and I got to talking about all of this, and he informed me he'd made plans to come down from Maine to see them at the Garden in March, further evidence of how much the band meant to him.</story>

         <story>Court And Spark was my first Joni Mitchell album. I picked it up on record during an excursion to the Newbury Street area with Luke, Paul, and Bairdo during the January half of Christmas break that year, completely unaware that within two years she'd be my favorite artist.</story>
         <notes>96.01  help me--joni mitchell
                    %u201Ccourt and spark%u201D was my first joni mitchell album.  i picked up the record during an excursion to the newbury street area with luke, paul d, and perhaps mike baird during the january half of christmas break that year. my first trip to the pour house also occurred during that excursion, an institution that would not compare to my obsession with joni mitchell in the coming years.

                    i swear there was something wrong w/that record--it played slower than it should have, altering the sound. reminded me of something i read that neil had said about listening to the analog records vs the cd sound.</notes>

         <notes>this one captured my imagination off the radio.

                    almost a crossover to vh1, though i wasn't watching so much these days.

                    liked the packing up and leaving story, with american cultural or geographical references.

                    what was their other song on the radio that might have even gotten a little bigger after this one ? head full of doubt

                    enjoyed watching their ascension.</notes>

         <artist>Tori Amos</artist>
         <story>John was in town, and had planned a gathering at Shawn and Alicia's house in Quincy. Laura and I went, but I disappeared for a while to play in a card game two towns over. I was intent on playing liberally, given I had a backup plan, and sure enough I was out in two hands, on my way back to hang out with everybody.

                    Earlier that day Laura's grandfather had died. It wasn't unexpected, but I didn't know how it would affect her. During that ride back to Quincy, I became acutely focused on her loss, wondering how she'd be later, the weight of implications lending power to the experience. I listened only to the The Beekeeper for the duration of that ride, infusing its textures into the memory indelibly.</story>
         <notes>05.05  the beekeeper - tori amos

                    i loved this song far more than any on the disc at early listens. nighttime playlist in 9 dane laura's room. listened to this over and over again on the ride to and especially from marc johnson's in holbrook back to shawn and alicia's w/john in town in the day or days after laura's grandfather died. it all felt extremely powerful.</notes>

         <story>Mumbles was in my room at Boys' State on one of the last days when a crowd of us belted out our own rousing redition of Plush, a radio anthem at the time, though apparently insufficient as it were--an acoustic version followed and became even more popular. The song was number 1 on the Z-Rock 50 the night Andy and I ran a mission for Operation Pissa - a coordinated effort to take a leak in whatever nearby towns we could drive to without raising alarms - also the night I forgot to pick up Peter at his friend's house and got in big trouble.</story>
         <notes>93.09  plush--stone temple pilots
                    mumbles may have been in my room at boys state on one of the last days when a bunch of us belted out our own rousing rendition of "plush." the song was huge on the radio at the time, and i was grateful for the opportunity to help raise the song to anthem status, at least for 8 or so people.


                    11. PLUSH--stone temple pilots (summer 1993)
                    truly the album version wasn't enough--the acoustic
                    version that played all over the radio reminds me of
                    pissing with andy d. on a night where the zrock 50
                    counted down to this at number 1, and i was so excited
                    about everything that i forgot to pick peter up at

                    i think i criticized j for purchasing steppenwolf's greatest hits when he did, me never thinking much of their radio songs (i think i criticized him for the csn box set too, two moments i'd be embarrassed to witness now (i eventually bought both for myself)). i have a strong impression of j firing this song up for me for the first time in his jeep, if not the night we drove to rich's off exit 6, then certainly the same weekend--early november, 1992.

One of them played American Boy on a cell phone, several of us huddled around to listen. To some it was new, but to me - given my extended recent acquaintance with the car radio - it was not, and my opinion of it was highly favorable. Shea, hearing it for the first time, commented on what a jam it was going to be at JY's BAD party that year.</story>

         <title>Bitter Sweet Symphony</title>
         <artist>The Verve</artist>
         <story>The first significant Bittersweet Symphony appearance in my life came while shopping at a Capitol Region mall with Abby. It played over a loudspeaker in some department store we walked by.

                    Another significant early listen came during a middle of the night ride to Pembroke for Thanksgiving break, after dropping by Laura's dorm in Hartford and spending a couple hours on the floor with her new cat. I took backroads across Connecticut and Rhode Island to get home, and the song came on at just about Providence. Still not knowing the artist, I was disappointed they didn't tell me.

                    When I eventually arrived in Pembroke I thought I was alone, only to be shocked to find Greg - gone since February - home early from Australia. Together we rode over to Bridgewater State to drop a surprise visit on Bairdo and Paul D, conveniently enrolled in the same class that morning.

                    Ultimately it would be Vog staking the most significant claim on the song, canonizing a drunken rendition of the tune and repeating the routine often, spawning many imitators.</story>
         <notes>97.20  bittersweet symphony--the verve
                    one of the first significant listens to this song for me came while shopping at one of the capitol region malls with abby--it played over loudspeakers in some department store we visited or walked by.  another significant listen came during the middle of the night ride to pembroke for thanksgiving break--i had stopped in at laura%u2019s for a couple hours of sleep - the reek from the box of the cat she had just acquired making my floorsleep particularly unpleasant - and heard the song at just about providence, having taken backroads out of hartford. i was still unaware of the artist at the time. another significant aspect of this voyage was its finale--when i eventually arrived in pembroke, i found greg back from australia a little early.

                    This song outgrew it's innocent beginnings--became the basis for the tune vogel used to hum when he got really drunk to annoy whomever was w/in range.</notes>

                    I went on a little Police kick in the first half of that year, picking up two of their records - Zenyatta Mondatta and Regatta De Blanc - blasting the latter from the basement shortly after I'd returned to Pembroke for the summer while Mike and I played chess in the living room. We played a few times and I never beat him.

                    mary was just about my fav on that disc.

                    oh yeah, laura and i saw one of their late night appearances at the ice house in feb / mar that year and i said at first hearing something besides take your mama that they sounded like pink floyd to me--turns out it was a floyd cover, which i wanted to take credit for, but it wasn't the song i was thinking of.</notes>

We eventually imagined that to live through Pearl Jam releases was to live through Led Zeppelin releases--the next generation wishes they saw what we did.  He got Physical Graffiti first and I borrowed it at some point, but before that he played it for me on a trip to Starland in "the green machine," the Aries station wagon he inherited.

                    By the time we arrived we had only heard a track and a half, because In The Light and Down By The Seaside were so long, but on the ride back we got to Ten Years Gone, which blew those two and most of the rest of the album away. That tape played in his car for the rest of the summer, most notably to and from double session football practices.</story>

         <story>While Pete and I shared a room in the basement we fell asleep to Bedtime Magic, a soft rock program and stark contrast to the TNT on AAF emanating from behind Greg's folding door. Greg played the radio loud enough so that not only could I hear the songs, I could learn the bands and song titles. That's how I came to know Alice In Chains and Would.

                    I caught the song a couple more times elsewhere on the approach to eleventh grade, but it wasn't until Them Bones made airplay that I decided to buy the album. At the time it still felt like a risk because the content was so heavy, but that notion dissolved quickly and Dirt went on to become one of the most important albums of high school.</story>

                    back in 10th grade peter and i listened to magic 106.7 at night, while the sounds of the tnt on aaf emanated from greg's room.  i remember hearing "would" through greg's folding door, then caught it a couple more times on the approach to 11th grade. when "them bones" made airplay, i decided to buy the album, which was a stretch for me at the time due to the heaviness of the content. alas, "dirt" became one of the most important albums of high school.  "down in a hole" was predominantly my favorite.

Late in the evening, Missy revealed she had made a tape for me to listen to on the plane trip to Colorado, which I regarded then as just about the sweetest thing anybody had ever done for me. The tape consisted mostly of 80s songs, and Broken Wings became one of two songs I listened to on repeat in the red Dodge Shadow after discovering its song seek feature, which magically found where songs on tapes started.</story>

         <story>It was surprising that such an overt show of trust in Jesus did substantial time on Boston radio, but it was enough for me to take notice, and even a liking to. It seemed that at the macro level Christian rock as a genre was going mainstream then. What ever happened to it?</story>

         <story>Rob let me borrow King Of Limbs at some point, but I didn't end up listening until my last days at ITA. I found myself in the building on a Saturday morning around that time, weighing the gravity of leaving the job after almost 9 years. The excitement of impending freedom welled up in a single moment while listening to Give Up The Ghost, no headphones, turned way up to reach the empty nearby offices on 5.</story>
         <notes>I burned this onto my computer at work... did rob let me borrow it? or burn me a copy? I remember listening in my last days there, as Google was moving in and I was getting out. I ended up in there on a Saturday morning weighing the gravity of leaving after almost 9 years, listening to this song, without my headphones, playing it loud. Nobody else was in the office at that time, anyway. All the excitement of freedom from my job sat with me in that moment.</notes>

                    By early that summer Paul had bought the CD and taped me a copy. I listened to it on headphones while mowing the lawn, a task I never needed music to complete before. Like Achtung, most of the songs on Ten did time as my favorite, and very few albums meant more to high school.</story>

                    "ten" was another of the most collosal albums of high school.  jim and i were excited to see that the slightly-older-than-us girl (who was she, jim--a cousin? a daughter of a parent's friend?), who joined us at marina bay the day we went to see the tall ships and fireworks, owned the album.  i don't think we listened to it that day, but i remember talking about it. i owned a copy of the album at that point thanks to paul d, whom i was with at bill t's house the day he bought the cd.</notes>

                    a big mariah kick for me coincided w/her first album in years, the emancipation of mimi, which, based on we belong together on the radio - such a beautiful, sensuous jam - i decided to go for. it did not disappoint--it was so much better than i expected, and i loved hearing all the hype it and she got over the next half year for it.

                    did this c-side and got huge props from these jacked braid-haired brothers in the house that night. greg was there that night, me believes.

                    more mature mariah.

                    i felt for her for whatever i'd heard about her mental struggles.

                    oh, that creative interplay when she's going through the dial hearing old songs... what incredible shape to a song.</notes>

         <notes>i remember getting into a little argument about whether this was death cab or not. pete said it wasn't - that he would have known if it was - even if he didn't know who it was. in any event, this song was radio magic. driving along route 62... thought it was winter, but that might just have been the lyrical imagery (cold and caked in snow). also heard a crucial play of this song in topeka on my cross country trip later that year.

                    didn't know snow patrol well... knew the light up song a bit, knew the puzzle pieces song that was the postal service... was that death cab. anyways, these bands clearly reminded me of each other. i should look up this bands hits and say something about how late to catch on to them i was.</notes>

         <story>Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me was all over the radio during the first half of my first summer back from Colorado, and naturally the first time I heard it was playing volleyball in Andy's front yard. I reinstituted my own personal "song of the day" for the month of June that year - a concept devised in study hall with Luke and Andy the year before - and Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me was the only song to score the honor three times that month.</story>

         <artist>Adele</artist>
         <story>I'll Be Waiting was easily my favorite track on the Adele album Laura had picked up, but unfortunately Laura's 6 disc - now in the dining room on a shelf - no longer displayed track numbers properly, and had lost sensitivity on the forward seek dial, making it difficult to get at specific tracks. I willed my way to the spot reapeatedly that spring, though, in order to dance to that song with Syd around the dining room, to get her to smile and even laugh a little, back when she was still not yet a year.</story>
         <notes>easily my favorite track on this album that laura had picked up. her 6 disc, now in the dining room on a shelf, didn't display the numbers of the tracks anymore, and it had an insensitive dial for tapping forward, as opposed to a discrete button - so it was really hard to figure out how to get to this track, but i got better at it. That spring I'd set this track and dance around the dining room with Syd to get her to smile and even laugh a little back when she was still not yet a year.</notes>

         <notes>I began listening to oldies on one of those TV music stations hard towards the end of 2010. I'd listen and I suppose watch while watching Syd, back when she could be left sleeping on the couch with no threat of rolling over.

                    This media - this particular station, in fact - would dominate my music intake for more than half a year. I became familiar with the sets of facts and images adding value to the music.

                    made a list of my top 10 oldies songs relative to what i used to think of them, meaning songs that i didnt know or whose greatness elevated significantly on account of me watching that channel.

                    Taking my calls from various waypoints, Elyse was aware of how into the song I had become. She managed to hunt down a Joan Baez Diamonds And Rust record, placing it face out in the second story window to my new room to greet me when I finally got there.</story>

         <story>My first listen to Joni Mitchell's Hejira was a standout. I didn't know any of the songs ahead of time, I was just going on faith--that any yet unheard Joni album was undiscovered wealth. This one reinforced that faith more than any other had.

                    Set in the Pembroke basement, I had just broken out the marker, intent on drawing a poster for Julie, Joni as inspiration. I drew two posters that night and still have them both--never got around to giving them away. The album went on to kill me for the remainder of the summer, its weight at times infringing on my everyday, as if when played it generated a field that somehow drew energy away from me.</story>

         <story>Cate and Rob both said All For Leyna was their favorite Billy Joel song, and so one of them dropped the track in their home directory at work for me to listen to, part of an effort to convince me to get on board with covering it in an ITA band project. Bruce, Wendi, myself and maybe others participated in a few practices in the unfinished space on 7, but the project never manifested.

                    As for All For Leyna, I had never heard it before--Glass Houses must have been one of the few Billy Joel albums Peter didn't have as a kid. I ended up liking it quite a bit, though.</story>
         <notes>07.09  all for leyna - billy joel

                    cate and rob both said this was their favorite billy joel song, and one of them brought the album in for me to listen to. we were considering covering this back when we were still a cover band... had they covered this before in another outlet? i had never heard it. i guess glass houses was one of the few billy joel tapes peter didn't have back when i was in high school and he was on a huge kick.

                    maybe they shared this song via home directory at work ? or some other kind of share system? i bet it was through our home dirs... along w/a few other candidates.

                    remember hanging out in that unfinished part of 7 after work and even playing w/the likes of wendi and bruce and whoever else. think we were considering crazy on you, lenny k's american woman, among others.</notes>

                    %u201Cleader of men%u201D was another important radio song that summer. the weekend prior to my last week at rowecom, i heard the song at just about dorchester bay on 93 riding south from uncle dan%u2019s - where i had stopped to pick up some softball equipment the morning after the closing ceremonies party in watertown - and the song only helped me to revel in my good mood at the time.</notes>

         <artist>Carole King</artist>
         <story>Kalaallit Nunaat played its second and final gig - at least under that name - at the ITA company party at F1 Boston. Brendan didn't work at ITA, and Raffa no longer did either, so we were down to just three--Rob, Rodney and myself.

                    Several times we tried to let that stop us, but Melissa persisted. Rodney and I approached Sean in his office to see if he wanted to join us. The rest is history.

                    Our seven song set of covers that night opened with I Feel The Earth Move, which I'd been a big fan of for a long time, including it on a mix tape for Maura a decade prior.</story>

                    preparing for and playing at the f1 gig. kalaallit nunaat w/a new lineup--no more raffa, replace brendan w/sean. melissa and crew pushed so hard for some in-house entertainment for this event... at her urging we went to sean and the rest is history. loved the rock version of this we opened with.

                    i'd been a big fan of this song for a long time. i had put this on a tape for maura in 96 or 97.</notes>

         <story>Brendan was playing the Rumble with Scamper, and I went to see him, earning myself an introduction to The Campaign For Real Time, also playing. I think they might have even won it that year, but whatever happened, they can take credit for introducing a new mode of music take to my life: myspace.

                    I remember asking Luke shortly thereafter if anybody had ever suggested their singer sounded like him. I thought he did.</story>

                    i went out to see brendan play the battle of the bands with scamper, and this band was playing that night. i think they ended up winning that year, underdogs as they were. in any event, so began my use of myspace as a means to draw music. i remember asking luke if anybody had ever suggested this sounds like him.

         <title>Cuts You Up</title>
         <artist>Peter Murphy</artist>
         <story>I heard the last half of Cuts You Up for the first time on The Leftover Lunch the year before, driving around somewhere near Porter Square. Shortly thereafter I mentioned it to Raffa, Money, and Q on a traditional Tuesday run to Big Burrito, at which point they demonstrated some familiarity, but not much.

                    I didn't realize until picking up the album some time later that I was only especially fond of the outro, which was most of what I'd heard on the radio that one time. Still, I listened to the album, particularly in my room just after a crucial rearrangement, with the head of the bed under the bay windows, just as it was getting warm enough to open them. Opening the windows admitted noise from the nearby Mass Pike, but thankfully, given the geometry of the neighborhood, the sound was reminiscent of a churning ocean, and rather peaceful.</story>
         <notes>04.08  cuts you up - peter murphy

                    i had heard this on the leftover lunch the year before, and brought it up on a big burrito trip shortly after (see other entry), but didn't listen much then--not til i bought the cd somewhere in person ( a yard sale ? a cd store trip after a h square lunch?) did i listen to it a lot, in my bedroom in allston, the one w/the windows open to the calm roar of the highway, like the beach.

                    mostly just love the end of this song... the chorus type parts.

                    ---

                    10. cuts you up - peter murphy
                    the once a week big burrito ritual was firmly entrenched in my life by the middle of that year, and music was a regular topic of conversation on the rides to and from the establishment. rob aquino demonstrated some awareness for "cuts you up" when i mentioned the song, having heard it driving near porter square some time shortly before. i kazaaed the song shortly after finding out about it.</notes>

         <story>Honest Mistake rode the same radiowaves as Take Me Out, except I didn't realize at the time it was only FNX playing it. It would be like six months before any other station caught on, if they even did. That would have been about January, when I went to see Luke and Leo and The Good North open for The Bravery at TT's. It was interesting to me that their opinions of the band had more to do with personal relationships than some song they heard on the radio.</story>

                    honest mistake rode the same radiowaves that take me out did, except i didn't realize at the time that it was only FNX playing this song, for like 6 months before any other station did, if ever. the next jan i went to see the good north at tt's--they were opening for the bravery, who i told them i was excited to see--their opinion of that band was weighted by personal connection, which was kind of interesting.

         <title>The Line Begins To Blur</title>
         <artist>Nine Inch Nails</artist>
         <story>I heard a radio DJ explain that Only was inspired by Trent Reznor's belief he is the lone soul in a world conjured around him, or something to that effect. I liked that philosophy. The rest of the album broached similar themes and the perfect musical accompaniment, alternately dissonant and peaceful, especially The Line Begins To Blur, which when the verse relents is such a relief you can't resist buying the message.

                    Emo Kid at work wanted to "bone" Trent Reznor but said this album sucked compared to previous NIN. What was his problem?</story>
         <notes>06.05  the line begins to blur - nine inch nails

                    i fell so hard for the dissonance on this album, particularly this song, and the beautiful peaceful contrast when it relents.

                    i heard a radio dj explaining that the impetus behind only was trent reznor's belief that the world is conjured around him, a philosophy i occasionally dabble in myself. anyways, the lyrics on this album are the kind that foster a deeper appreciation and kinship with the music for me than instrumental ever could.

                    i remember evan claiming he loved trent reznor but that this new album sucked. i didn't agree with him on that one.

                    what was that one song trent reznor had that was released between albums around this time?

                    the perfect drug was on a mix of mine from around that time... 04 or 05... might have been the one around the time of our cross country trip.

         <artist>Paper Route</artist>
         <story>I took Laura to see Paramore at the House of Blues on Lansdowne for her birthday that year, where the opening act was a band I'd never heard of called Paper Route--safe to say they were the winners on the night. Paramore was good, but Paper Route blew expectations - none - out of the water.

                    One of the Paper Routers - skinny fellow with a bald head - was greeting people as they exited. I suspected most people didn't even pick up on that it was him, but I noticed, and relished the opportunity to look him in the eye and tell him, with as much conviction as I could muster, "you guys were badass." I picked up their CD before we left and listened to it a lot in the following months. The picture on the back of the album, of the kids laying on the hill sleeping - under a spell, perhaps - was exactly the way most of the album felt.</story>

         <story>The Strokes burst hard onto the scene at the end of 2001, and everybody seemed to be in on their preeminence. They were played at Steveo and Al's party in Somerville that December when Luke commandeered the stereo in an attempt to start a dance party in the living room. He enjoyed some success while hearing no complaints about the music.

                    By the time I got back to Seattle in January, Shawn had the album, and so I had every opportunity to listen, which I did, including once while drawing on posterboard an image of the lead singer from the liner notes. I left that poster unfinished for a while, only to resume and eventually complete in a far less literal and significant contrast of a hand.</story>

         <story>At the end of tenth grade Josh moved to California. His first return was at the end of that summer, just ahead of eleventh grade, at which time Sarah arranged a gathering at her house so friends could see him again. At that gathering Josh told me about a new Jefferson Airplane album he had discovered - 2400 Fulton Street - a double album that we couldn't figure into their timeline.

                    As planned, I gave him the blank tape he had (via Sarah) instructed me to bring, so he could make me a copy. As a double album though, the whole thing didn't fit on one tape, unfortunately.</story>

         <title>Into The Open</title>
         <artist>The Velvet Teen</artist>
         <story>Into The Open was Sydney's birth song to me. I listened to it while carrying her as a newborn all about our hospital room, a few down from the one in which she'd entered into the world. That the song was an address from father to child - even if a distressing one - was a coincidence.

                    I first heard The Velvet Teen in a Lawrence, Kansas bar, on my trip in 2008, no clue what it was at the time, but determined to lift a few lines from the din and scrawl them on a scrap of paper. I forgot that capture for a while, just one scrap in a pile of many to sift through when I got home, and even then, journal entries taken on loose scraps were dropped when I originally compiled the Web page to recount the trip.

                    I had never heard of the band before finding out who they were through those lyrics. It's fun to think the musical fabric of the nation is unevenly distributed, such that the bands played in different regions are likewise different, even when within the same genre.</story>
         <notes>This is my Syd birth song. I held her as a newborn and walked about the hospital room in which she was born to this song. was laura in the room then? hey, i should check that email i sent back then.. that was fun to write.

                    learned about them through lyrics on my trip in 2008, in lawrence, kansas. the lyrics were captured on scraps that had gone forgotten for a while, for they didn't end up part of the trip web page delivered in jan that year.

                    i had never heard of the band before finding out who they were through those lyrics. fun to think that the musical fabric of the nation is unevenly distributed, such that i'm likely to learn about bands i don't know about simply by immersion in other parts of the country for intervals.

                    love that the lyrics were somewhat appropriate for a birth, or at least a parent child relationship.

         <story>That August I was transitioning from Watertown with Tate and Matt to Allston with J and Mike, but in the interim I had a month to fill, so it was convenient that Nick and Trav needed a housesitter. I spent the first ten days of the month living at their place in Braintree.

                    Each of those nights I opted for the CD player over the television, and so I would turn on the fan, lay on the couch, and use the remote control to rifle through hundreds of discs. I found Alphaville among them, a band I knew for their one big hit, Big In Japan - so big in fact it appeared twice on the CD - and got stuck on that disc for more than a few listens. Do You Want To Dance With Me became my favorite.</story>

MaryLynn and Josh had done the honors, and we spoke about the album a bit when that became clear to me. Greg crossed the porch a minute later, before the song was over, and I let him know too how much I loved it.</story>
         <notes>this one tapped into me, made me think there was new music out there that could pull off the magic. i listened to the radio hoping for this one.

                    greg was there, i remember sharing with him that i loved this song.

                    i had heard of this guy long ago, and knew about his stephen stills story. ray lamontagne was one of the artists jenny from indiana had suggested i listen to that night in indianapolis two years before.</notes>

         <title>Sugar Mountain</title>
         <artist>Neil Young</artist>
         <story>Bill and I took a Greyhound to New Hampshire that February vacation to catch up with J and go skiing for a weekend. I had just bought two tapes - The Doors Greatest Hits and Neil Young's Live Rust - both of which I brought with me and listened to on my Walkman.

                    I was already a big Neil fan, and was most interested in tracking down Sugar Mountain, though I would have preferred the studio version, I just didn't know where to find it. The primary means for learning which songs were on which albums back then was studying the backs of the tapes on the racks at the stores, and as I only found out a year or so later, after acquiring Neil's Decade, a collection of his work spanning his first ten years as an artist, Sugar Mountain never appeared on any of his albums. By then it was moot, however, since Decade had the version I wanted.</story>

         <artist>Linkin Park</artist>
         <story>Linkin Park was getting more and more difficult to sing along with--the high held notes were just getting ridiculous. Loved the imagery though, of the divide, the ashes that fell like snow, and the ground that caved in between where we were standing.</story>
         <notes>these are getting harder and harder to sing along with... that guy is getting ridiculous. still quite liked this jam, though. driveway at maynard, sitting in the car listening the song out.

We had previously bonded over how awesome AAF was in the late 90s and early 2000s, and so it was mostly of those kind of jams, including a Monster Magnet selection to represent who he knew I knew was his favorite band of the era.</story>

                    this song was the gem on the second side of the tape that i looked forward to hearing, particularly for that flair in her voice -- the super high pitched run she pulls off once or twice.</notes>

         <story>Beauty Shop was all over TV that winter, commercials and all, but I watched it a few times, kind of a guilty pleasure. The song that played at the end over the credits I immediately recognized as something I'd hardly ever heard - maybe even just once - but loved. I fumbled through my travel journal to prove it, and sure enough found a few lyrics to Jill Scott's Golden scratched out on a page next to an entry written in Valdosta, Georgia.</story>

                    rundgren's second album, and the next one i borrowed from bruce. double album. guess this qualifies as a huge, abrupt rundgren kick. when did greg and bill and i see him?

                    a wizard, a true star - the album art, that drawing of the face, kinda like some king crimson art from back in the day.

                    this must have been right about the time i moved desks at ita, from raffa's room to the corner on 7. i think i recall a nearly worn out international feel in that new desk. bruce came in to my office once to track something down and saw the mariah carey disc there--he didn't like that. :)</notes>

                    When J, with whom my musical taste had parted years before, informed me he had taken to listening to new kinds of music, and went on to cite Staind as a representative, I could not have been more elated--we were back on the same page. That summer we ended up listening to the album together, during a rendezvous at his parents' place in Nebraska, driving left and right across the plains after leaving Bill and Jenny at the Denver airport.</story>

                    93.08  two heads--jefferson airplane
                    i purchased "after bathing at baxters" at the strawberries in the north river plaza; the night following the evening i did so was nothing short of a revelation. i played the cd repeatedly that night on the stereo in my basement room while working on a paper for mr. darche's period 2 history class. later experiments with my cd player's random feature taught me the thing liked to play the same song twice in a row. "two heads/won't you try saturday afternoon" became the only song random ever chose 3 straight times.


                    6.  TWO HEADS--jefferson airplane (late spring 1993)
                    i bought this cd the evening before i had some huge
                    mr. darche paper due, and i listened to it while i
                    wrote it.  every song that came on i was amazed at how
                    it was actually better than the one before it.  two
                    heads was actually the second last song, so im not
                    sure how that works.</notes>

         <story>In the wake of deciding not to play out while Sean and I had kids in 2010, I continued to visit Rob at his house most weeks through the winter and play acoustically. We started doing covers, almost exclusively 70s and 80s soft rock. I knew Leader Of The Band from the car radio in young childhood, and had heard it enough times to keep it on the radar, but hadn't given it much more than that. Turns out it was right in my wheelhouse, for both singing and sentimentality.</story>
         <notes>In the wake of deciding not to play out while Sean and I had our 2010 babies, I continued to visit Rob at his house most weeks through the winter and play acoustically. We started doing a few covers, almost exclusively 70s and 80s soft rock. I knew Leader Of The Band from the car radio in young childhood and had probably heard it enough times to keep it on the radar, but I hadn't given to such focused attention as required to play it. Music starts to become something different when you look at it that way--not better or worse, just different.</notes>

My Walkman that day played host to The Best Of The Guess Who and The Worst Of Jefferson Airplane, the latter of which I splurged to buy at Caldor despite having access to the record (that one was kinda scratchy anyway).

                    As for the Guess Who, I had heard No Time on ZLX some months before and decided to take a chance on The Best Of The Guess Who for Bill for his birthday. After listening to the album for a month at Bill's, I decided to buy myself a copy.</story>

         <story>Bruce and I shared an appreciation for Neil, who along with Frank Zappa and Todd Rundgren represented his heroes, by his own proclamation. Following the logic, I borrowed the first Todd Rundgren album from him.

                    I already knew Saw The Light and Hello It's Me, but Rundgren clearly had more dimension. I loved the part in I Went To The Mirror when he's singing about "the first thing to come into focus," how the music makes that great warping sound, suggesting the mirror imagery he's singing about does the same.</story>
         <notes>04.04  i went to the mirror - todd rundgren

                    borrowed the first todd rundgren album from bruce, probably after talking up neil and finding out neil, along w/zappa and rundgren were his favs. knew saw the light and hello it's me, obv. loved the warp noise during "the first thing to come into focus," and that he only uses that device once. semi-psychadelic-seventies feel. this was the last track, and it got me more than any of the others.

         <notes>this video, with all the various scenes at the beginning the voyeur style view of this woman's life in a foreign place, a lonely setting, but something beautiful about it. i played it at rob's house on his kitchen counter. it made the other video's on the countdown look like chumps. the countdown kept me interested as long as there was only two or three videos really worth watching, and this one played that role for as long as an indie jam can survive on that program amid all the hyperpop product.

         <story>Fireflies was a radio song that sounded like a synthetic version of Death Cab. Peter, the Death Cab authority in my life, lent credence to this view by somewhat agreeing. Not to say I didn't love it though, because I did, rocking it as hard as I could at Andy J's karaoke going away party.</story>
         <notes>a radio song that i initially thought sounded a lot like death cab though clearly wasn't them... almost like whoever it was was trying to out death cab death cab. peter had the same feeling i recall after talking to him about it.

                    i did this karaoke at andy joynt's going away party that year.

                    another compelling video - the kid w/all his electronic old school toys coming to life in his room - that outdid almost every other video at the time and provided a reason to tune into the countdown.</notes>

         <story>Aenima was slow to crest on the radio wave, doing so over the course of six months to a year, until summer 1998 when it became the reason I turned on the radio. Pulling into South Shore Medical Center that fall to get a knee injury looked at I caught the song at the beginning, and opted to stay in the car and listen. When the BCN DJ went on to say it was probably the best song to come out in the past ten years, well that was extremely satisfying.</story>

                    %u201Caenima%u201D was slow to rise to the crest of the radio wave, doing so over the course of 6 months to a year, until summer 1998 when it became the reason i turned on the radio.

                    15. AENIMA--tool (summer 1998)
                    the reason i turned on the radio this summer was to
                    hear tool--and how pumped did i get when that slow
                    driving bass kicked in and you got to hear the song
                    from the beginning?  when pulling into south shore
                    medical center to get me knee checked for the second
                    time this past fall, that's exactly the way it went,
                    and when the BCN dj went on to say that it was
                    probably the best song to come out in the past 10
                    years, i didn't want to get out of the car.</notes>

         <story>I turned to Laura in the theatre during the party scene in Garden State to tell her I recognized who was playing in the background, and how proud I was of the call. That turned out to be the best scene in a movie that was otherwise pretty good anyway.

                    I had a suspicion that Cook might know something about this band, so I got to asking him about them at some point. He explained that the album was interesting, but not quite anything like the two songs I was familiar with. I discovered that for myself when I went and picked it up anyway, and even though he was right, I took quite a liking to most of it.</story>

                    this played during the party scene - the best scene - of the superhype zak braff movie garden state. i was so proud of myself for guessing during the movie scene as it played in the theatre in that it was zero 7, that band from mtv back in early 02. eventually talked to tom c about the album, which he had and described a bit for me. i ended up picking it up myself... only a couple numbers w/the two girls singing, but some of the other stuff was good too.</notes>

I explained I'd heard Phantom Limb on the radio a few times and liked it, but that what convinced me to buy the album was hearing it play while playing cards at Eli and Patrick's apartment in Central. They had a computer wired to the television, selecting songs and playlists using the remote, which didn't really have anything to do with it, but it was a nice touch.</story>

         <story>I bought Very years before, while living in Watertown for the first time, and at the time I didn't much like it. That changed in 2005. I don't know what compelled me to try again, but doing so knocked my musical taste off its axis, wobbling the whole rotation. I'd end up calling it one of my five favorite albums of all time. The opening smash to Can You Forgive Her conveyed so much energy, heightened yet by sitting in Laura's car in the garage near her work waiting for her to escape so we could drive off to the Southwest together.</story>
         <notes>05.09  can you forgive her? - pet shop boys

                    oh, this tape. i had bought it years before, but never really got into it. not sure why i picked it up again, but once i did i could not put it down. powerful listen in the parking lot to laura's work while i waited for her to get out so we could take off on our cross-country trip to the southwest.

                    that crashing beginning... dear god this album is awesome. if idm has godfathers, do they know it's these guys ?

                    this could represent a complete redirect in my taste at the time. like an earthquake knocking earth just off its axis.</notes>

         <story>I went to see Brendan play the Abbey on a random Friday, and the last act of the night was a band called The Luxury. As they were just about set up the lead singer addressed the audience for a bit before cutting himself off with "let's play some music." Then they blew the doors off that nigh empty room. When I heard not long after they were opening for Coldplay at The Garden I wasn't even all that surprised.</story>
         <notes>i went to see brendan play the abbey on a random friday night. the luxury was the last act. i had never heard them. they blew the doors off that nigh empty room, such that when i heard they were opening for coldplay i wasn't even all that surprised. i particularly loved the first song they did, which i later recognized on their myspace page at the time they finally posted it as "take it back."

                    the first song thing is a common pattern for me, making me wonder if there's some science behind that, but anyways, didn't learn what it was until some time the following year, after we'd played brendan's queen cover up and was introduced to jason. that night i told him i liked the first song, then later </notes>

                    something about the experiences i'd just had in louisiana colored my impression of lil wayne, like i had a bit of a sense of where he came from, more than i would have otherwise, anyway.</notes>

         <story>We had the record player set up downstairs in Maynard the first winter we were there, and I took to using it occasionally. Gerry Rafferty's City To City was one of my favorite records at the time, and so was in heavy rotation. I was already down with the hits, so I started going for the less familiar selections, including Home And Dry.</story>

         <story>Jim and I compared notes about the latest Silversun Pickups at Jackson's birthday party at J and K's that summer. I told him how much I loved Panic Switch, and that I thought it represented well for a sophomore effort, to which he responded excitedly - after learning I didn't have the album - that there were about five better songs than that on it. Despite that compelling review, I never looked into it, not quite falling for the next radio song.</story>

                    comparing notes with jim at jackson's party at j's and k's that summer. told him how much i loved the song, thought they were really representing for a second album effort, he said there were about 5 songs on the album better than that one, never looked into it, though. i didn't love the next radio song.

                    luke had put a silversun pickups song on one of his yousendit mixes.

                    saw this band live w/spoth at austin.

                    i was pretty convinced this was a female singing for a long while.</notes>

         <story>These were the guys from Creed but without the lead singer, so where did the voice come from? Was he really just waiting for a chance? Well, given one, he owned it, across the whole album but acutely on the second line in the second verse of Rise Today: "hope we find a better way before we find we're left with nothing."

                    I eventually bought this album while in Disney with Laura and Greg and Laura the following January, on a morning trip over to Pleasure Island. I was happy to hear it on a TV show promo not long after, for let the world take notice.</story>

                    alterbridge... the guys from creed. man, though, this guy's voice is incredible--especially that second line in the second verse "hope we find a better way before we find we're left with nothing". i eventually bought this album while in disney with laura, greg, and laura the following jan, on a morning trip over to pleasure island ( i think that's what it was... the shopping place by day.)

                    was happy to see this used on some tv show commercial not long after. world take notice of how hard this jam is rocking!</notes>

         <story>My parents had To Our Children's Children's Children kicking around on tape and I adopted it for a while, senior year of high school. It played to my Walkman on the baseball bus, out the stereo in the red Dodge Shadow we'd just gotten as a third family car for the kids - two of us with a license, soon to be three - and notably on an old boombox while raking at Grammy and Papa's cottage in Manomet for a second straight spring. Grammy and Papa stopped in on me this time, then Grammy stopped in her tracks and began swaying to Watching And Waiting, claiming she liked the music.

                    just a jam i caught on the radio only a few times, driving around near rodney's old house and ita... maybe moving my car back to the lot after having it at the house. it caught my attention perhaps before i realized it was a new perry farrell band. i might have made that last part up. maybe i suspected it was him then confirmed ? who knows... it's fun to listen to now and think it captured my imagination in earlyish 08.</notes>

         <story>Another of the most popular videos at the time was Zero 7's Destiny, but unlike Fell In Love With A Girl, Here To Stay, Tribute, and others, the TV was the only place I heard Destiny, making me wonder about the reach of this band I'd never heard of otherwise. It didn't seem impossible the song was "made for TV," because the brush stroke animation in the video was compelling enough to propel any song, and because as much as I liked the song, it didn't match any pop / rock / indie profile I could figure.</story>

         <title>Red Rain</title>
         <artist>Peter Gabriel</artist>
         <story>I was invited to sing with the ITA band on the Boston Harbor cruise in September that year, perhaps because I had told Christina I liked to sing, and despite that I'd never done so in any legit capacity. She must have relayed my interest, and nobody was going to say no, so I got caught up in it more so than I was pushing for it, for sure.

                    Regardless, I got the lead on a few numbers, and we practiced at work, in an empty office on the other side of the seventh floor. Christina submitted that Red Rain sounded the best, and it was my favorite too, but unfortunately on the night of the cruise I was way off on that one. Luckily I had Led Zeppelin's Rock and Roll to end with, a song I was far more comfortable with, and a performance I hoped would help erase memories of the earlier one.</story>
         <notes>15. red rain - peter gabriel
                    i was invited to sing with the ita band on the boston harbor cruise in september that year - somehow it occurred to them that i could sing. in the days leading up to the event, i made a tape of the songs on the playlist and practiced singing along with them in my car. christina said "red rain" sounded the best during the practice sessions - it was probably my favorite of all the selections, despite that it was the hardest to learn - but "rock and roll" (led zeppelin) ended up being the hit of the show come showtime.

         <story>Elyse had left a mix of her own in my car years prior, the final song on which was Wade In The Water, a traditional song by some artist neither of us could identify. My mission to find out who it was lasted longer than such missions can last anymore, Internet and all. The Internet was sort of around then too, but the problem with this particular song was that it had been done by a hundred or more artists, so which was the right version?

                    After working through eBay and finding the incorrect adaptation, I eventually returned to allmusic.com - and then to Newbury Comics - to determine the artist was named Ellen McIlwaine. I also determined there were other songs on her CD I was interested in, like All To You.</story>

Not long after, we and a few friends saw Neil perform the song and others at Great Woods--my first concert. Blind Melon was the opener, then Soundgarden, then Neil - a ridiculous lineup - and though I enjoyed it immensely it was not long before I began developing a sense I'd under-appreciated it. That notion grew to tragic proportions as both Blind Melon and Soundgarden went on to rate among my favorite acts from the decade I grew up in.</story>

I stole the disc for running my parents van between Maynard and Kingston that summer, in the process of moving back to the South Shore.</story>
         <notes>Laura bought this CD and left it in the car somewhere near the middle. I let it keep playing on a day that the dash was out such that I couldn't read track numbers. Some of the songs got to me, but only one in particular. When listening later with the dash alight anew I discovered that the one I really liked was the first track. I made a point to steal this disc from the car to listen while making runs in my parents' van to cart our stuff from Maynard to Kingston in moving back to the south shore.

                    really liked that the structure - specifically odd, varied timings between verses and choruses - seemed to suggest that parts of the songs were tectonic plates shifting into each other like the lyrical imagery suggested.</notes>

         <artist>Grant Lee Phillips</artist>
         <story>Luke used yousendit to mass-distribute a modern day mix, and a double album at that. I checked out the half of them that were in MP3 format - my work computer wouldn't read the M4As - and loved Grant Lee Phillips' cover of So. Central Rain.</story>
         <notes>luke oneil used yousendit to deliver a collection of songs - sort of a modern day mix, and a double album i think - to bbjones and whoever else he sent it to. i went for it only to discover half the songs were in a format my computer wouldn't read. the other half, though, the mp3s, i listened to quite a bit, from the 5 corner office overlooking the garment district. south central rain was my fav among them. what were the rest ? some panic at the disco song, lloyd, i don't want to be heartbroken or whatever it was called.

         <story>Wes D. furnished the latest Soundgarden release at Kristen's volleyball party the afternoon of the senior prom--time we were supposed to be using to get handsome for the event, or at least theoretically that's why they let us out of school early. Spoonman had been played, Black Hole Sun was just coming up over the radio. I eventually bought the CD for myself and played it at my own graduation party.</story>

         <artist>U2</artist>
         <story>By the middle of 10th grade, Bill had been trying to sell me on the Beatles for a while. I went for a few songs - Dear Prudence, She's So Heavy, Happiness Is A Warm Gun - but not much else, though in fairness I couldn't get him to listen to Neil Young, either.

                    Fortunately we agreed on The Joshua Tree, which was also among the first compact discs he (or his older brother) owned, back when a digital display of track number and time elapsed was novel.</story>
         <notes>It was the middle of 10th grade. Bill and I listened to compact discs in his basement, where we hung out regularly. while playing Star Frontiers and Lords of Conquest. The digital display on his brother's flat, Bill was trying to make me like the Beatles. I went for it a bit - I liked Dear Prudence and She's So Heavy and perhaps a few more from the double disc White Album few songs of the double disc White Album - but I wasn't sold on the earlier stuff. I just didn't know.

                    In Bill's basement we took to role-playing and computer games while listening to Compact Discs when they were still new technology. The digital display of track numbers and a timer

                    bill t and i listened to "the joshua tree" in his basement with regularity mid-10th grade.  he copied the cd onto a tape for me so that i could listen to it in my own basement room. "in gods country" inspired the popular-during-high-school painting of the three flying ships (note the "desert rose"), which jim h. cleverly dubbed "columbus eve."</notes>

         <title>Crazy For You</title>
         <artist>Madonna</artist>
         <story>Maura and I danced to Crazy For You at the Key Club karaoke dance that November. We began dating the following year and it went on to become our song. When making a tape for her some time later I wanted to include it, and so I ended up calling a bunch of girls from our class to track down the right Madonna tape.

                    That turned out to be the easy part. I ended up needing to shorten one side of that tape by about ten seconds, which meant I had to tape the last few songs over each other and closer together each time several times to get it to fit perfectly. Yes, a cliche, but rewarding nonetheless.</story>
