        <h3>The Soundtrack 500</h3>
        <p>
            Hello, welcome to the soundtrack. 25 years, 20 songs per year.
        </p>
        <div class='tab read-year'>start from the beginning</div>
        <h3>The Key</h3>
        <p>
            The more significant the song, the darker the background on its title (or just jump to the
        <span style="font-weight: bold; cursor: pointer;" class="show-overall">top 100</span> to see them in order). Color represents
            proportional contribution to that significance:
        </p>
        <p>
        <li><div class="title-button" style="margin:1px;font-weight:bold;background-color:rgba(255,0,0,0.25)">redder</div> -> the more I like the song now</li>
        <li><div class="title-button" style="margin:1px;font-weight:bold;background-color:rgba(255,255,0,0.25)">yellower</div> -> the more representative the song at the time</li>
        <li><div class="title-button" style="margin:1px;font-weight:bold;background-color:rgba(0,0,255,0.25)">bluer</div> -> the more meaningful of other people the song is to me (shared enjoyment or experience; reminicent of, vice versa, both; general popularity)</li>
        </p>
        <p>
            It follows that orangey would mean good for me and the soundtrack, but I kinda went it alone... or green
            would mean I shared it with others and it is important to the soundtrack, but it's just not a jam that I
            love so hard anymore...
        </p>
        <h3>The Songs</h3>
        <p>
            I've been more or less collecting the song list the whole time. It doesn't represent an exhaustive list of
            <i>favorite</i> songs -- for example, one song from a great album experienced acutely may have "crowded out"
            other great songs from the album -- plus there was fluctuating enthusiasm, a variety of memory augmentation
            techniques available at different times, the fact that I was more than twice as old at the end than at
            the beginning... in a sense, the list is a bit arbitrary. That's not to say without meaning,
            however, because if nothing else, for a song to appear here has "raised it to stardom" for me,
            eclipsing and diminishing the stature of what were perhaps more worthy songs.
        </p>
        <h3>The Beginning</h3>
        <p>
            It began in 1992, when most of my calendar-oriented thoughts about music ended up on the
            pages of composition notebooks, and in the liner notes of mix tapes, of course.
            I ended up with a lot of handwriting and mix tapes entitled "92 songs", "93 songs", "94 songs, part 1"
            -- kinda jumped the gun on that one, since I was headed to Air Force Academy and guessed
            I wouldn't have much opportunity to listen to music (correctly, it turns out) -- and of course, "95 songs".
        </p>
        <h3>The Advent of the Internet</h3>
        <p>
            Shortly thereafter email entered the picture, and musical musings became a shared expression -- many a list
            of songs and bands and albums raced between friends across the Internet. For example, in March, 1999,
            I spent time producing my own "20 most powerful songs" list, to mass distribute via email (which,
            almost twenty years later, turned out to be a key piece of research for this project). To start, I took my
            year-in-review mix tapes from a half decade prior and standardized the song lists to 20 each, then
            updated my record to include the intervening years, before whittling it down to the 20 I considered of
            greatest importance then.
        </p>
        <h3>The Ten Year Mark</h3>
        <p>
            Realizing I had something going, I continued to collect 20 songs per year, working on it in streaks, until
            the ten year mark, at which point I formally composed, in the body of one long email, the "soundtrack" of
            the last ten years of my life, complete with stories that aren't much different than the ones that appear
            here now (it's been more of a maintenance effort on the older content since then).
        </p>
        <h3>2003</h3>
        <p>
            In 2003 I got proactive and generated the 20 songs with stories almost immediately after the year ended.
            Not quite sure what that was all about, but I was glad I didn't have to work so hard later on !
        </p>
        <h3>Twenty Years</h3>
        <p>
            My email collection is littered with self-addressed scraps attempting to keep up to date until the twenty
            year mark. It was then that I decided to marry my love of organized information to what programming I had
            learned and make a Web site out of it. It was mostly Python and a big in-memory XML document (mirrored to
            disk) queried by applying XSL, plus XSL on the browser too (along with CSS and jQuery), so pretty
            unorthodox, and a little ridiculous on the XSL (not an apology :)), but it remained responsive, though I
            was a bit surprised it did. Obviously I had to catch up on the stories at that point, exercising my own UI,
            not notebooks or email.
        </p>
        <h3>Twenty-five Years</h3>
        <p>
            So this is now. Added the last 100 entries, plus I added the tags and the people as links
            from within the stories, so that you can pivot the soundtrack around them. And I did the rankings on three
            axes, which seemed a little weird given that, as explained above, the list is a bit arbitrary to begin with,
            but still, kinda fun (fwiw, the formula for calculating the overall rankings used for the "top 100"
            tab involves a 10^x, to value the top spots more, expanding the significance of the difference between
            1 and 2 over, say, 101 and 102). The timelines showing release date vs soundtrack date are new too.

            The app is Java / Spring boot, but this time w/JSON everywhere instead of XML, and still CSS / jQuery
            on the front end.
        </p>
        <h3>The End</h3>
        <p>
            That's it for now :) Enjoy the songs and stories and let me know if you do !
        </p>
